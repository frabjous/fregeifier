# The Amazing Fregeifier

The Fregeifier is a collection of tools for rendering unusual mathematics in documents and webpages, including things such Gottlob Frege’s logical notation or that of Russell and Whitehead’s *Principia Mathematica*.

It is currently early in development, and the initial goal will be to create a filter for pandoc that compiles complex mathematics in spans and divs with the fregeify class into images that can be embedded into, e.g., html and epub documents.
